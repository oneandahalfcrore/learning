1. the name of the variable is converted into address internally to access the value 

2. Declaring Variables 
   --> syntax : datatype variable ( example - int marks)

3. Data Types
   --> primitive
       these are predefined
       boolean , char , byte , short , int , long , float , double

   --> non-primitive
       classes , Arrays, interfaces

4. Primitive Data types
   (JVM platform decides the size of the datatypes)
   --> boolean 
   --> byte 
       can store whole numbers from -128 to 127
       can be used instead of int or other data types to save memory when u are certain
       that the value will be within -128 and 127
       it occupies 8 bits.  
   --> char
       character must be surrounded by single quotes 
       java uses unicode not ascii
   --> short
       this datatype can store -32678 to 32767
       occupies 16 bits
   --> int
       occupies 4 bytes of data
   --> long
       occupies 8 bytes of data
       ends with "l"
   --> float
       single precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
       as the floating point number increases ex- 2.54678 it will be able to either map 2.5 or 2.6 so the accuracy will decrease and we will lose the data
       as the number increases.this is a major problem in case of fintech companies.
       ends with "f"
   --> double
       double precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point
       more accuracy than float
       ends with "d"

5. Naming Variables
   --> all the variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet , an underscore (_) , or a dollar sign ($)
   --> the $ and _ are allowed but discouraged u shuld try to not use them as the beginning letter
   --> after the first initial letter , variable names may also contain letters and the digits 0 to 9 , but not any special symbols except _ and $
   --> no spaces are allowed
   --> variable names do not occupy space . symbol table is used for mapping variable name to address.
   --> the name can be of any length ( u can have as long as 65000 characters) but this practice is discouraged.   
   --> u cannot use java keyword ( reserved keyword) for a variable name.  
   --> variable names are case sensitive . using ALL uppercase letters are primarily used to identify constant variables.  

6. initialising variables
   --> a variable can be initialised when it is declared.
   --> whenever we give the value first time to a variable it is called initialisation.
   --> syntax : datatype variablename = value
