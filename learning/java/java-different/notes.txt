1. what makes java different ?

   -- language simplicity
   -- dififcult to introduce a bug and easy to find a bug
   -- very less undefined behaviour (ex- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException in JAVA but segmentation fault (occurs when u 
      try to access memory out of the process) in C++ and it might run also sometimes without giving segmentation fault)
   -- automated memory management 
      the garbage collector will take care of freeing up the heap space 
   -- java does not have pointers 
      direct manipulation on memory is not allowed . this increases readability and makes the program error free
      (when writing code which wants to interact with machine then pointers in c/c++ is good but if u are building
       an application which is not a system software java is really helpful)
