 1. every java program has the same structure 

2. a java program consists of one or more of the following sections :
   --> Documentation section -- which task the program is performing 
       general tradition is to write the name of the person who has written the 
       program and the date on which the program is written and the company name .
       present in every program

   --> Package statement -- putting similar types of things in one box called package
       classifying the code into various folders and putting related code together in 
       one folder. ex.-- u can put code related to simple data structures in one folder ,
       advanced data structures in one folder and the code related to input output in one folder.
       present in every program
       cannot have more than one package statements in a file
       same package statement can be used with any number of files so that related files go in one folder.

   --> Import statement 
       using import statement u can include the whole code or a piece of code 
       may not be present in every program

   --> Class Definition
       everything u write in java needs to be present in some class
       present in every program

   -->  Main method definition
        interpreter does not know from ehich line to start the execution therefore main method
        may not be present in every program . example if u are writing code used in another program then there is no need to write main method

3. #include v/s import
   --> # include is used for header files which contains only the definitions of the functions and variables so 
       # include only copy paste those definitions of functions and variables. 
   --> import actually imports the code from other folders into the program .the code contains need not only contain definitions of functions and variables.

4. explanation of the program through screenshots 
   
5. java.util.sc means that the java.util folder contains scanner file

6. --> every file should have a public class and the name of the public class should be same as file name .
   --> ex- public class Reechika     Reechika.java
   --> there can be only one public class in a file.
   --> suppose if u are writing a program having main inside class then u have to make that class public .
   --> Use PascalCasing to write the names of the class

7. u will never be able to run a program without main

8. java is case sensitive .

9. String[] args
   --> whenever u want to pass something as an input to the program through the command line we can take use of String[] args which is an array of strings.
   --> even when u do not want to read anything still u have to write String[] args.
   --> write java followed by file name (//give the input strings which will be passed to the String[] args)

10. what happens when we declare the main function as private instead of public ?
    --> the interpreter (JVM) will not be able to find the method main
    --> since private methods are only accessible to the class they are in and since JRE is outside the class 
        we need to grant permission to use main by making main method public .

11. System.out.println()
    --> println is not defined inside the program but still we are using it because it is a library function
        but we have also not imported any library.
    --> we have not used import statement because System.out.println is included inside java.lan package and by default
        every program will get java.lang without even including it .
    --> system is a final class defined in the java.lang package.this means there is a class System present in the file inside 
        lang folder and the class is final(i.e. in order to use this class u do not have to create any object )
    --> out is an instance of PrintStream which contains member function println

12. creating a new project

13. the program that we write is called the src code .

14. creating first java program FirstJavaCode
