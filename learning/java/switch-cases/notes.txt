1. switch case statement is used when we have mutiple options to select.the option is selected 
   through the value of an expression.

2. syntax of switch expression in screenshot

3. break and default in switch case statements

4. if-else v/s switch
   --> large conditions prefer switch small conditions prefer if-else

5. we can not use duplicate values in switch cases.see question number 1 screenshot 

6. the value for the case must be the same datatype as the variable in the switch.see question number 2 screenshot

7. the value for a case must be  a constant or a literal . Varaiables are not allowed.see question number 3 screenshot
   because the compiler builds switch cases as a very fast lookup table at COMPILE TIME. and variable value can change when program runs hence it is not allowed.
   if we do need it to be a variable not a constant we should use if else.

8. the default statement can be present anywhere in the cases , if it is present in between then break statement should be used.defaul statement is optional.
